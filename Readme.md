## About

df-generator is a commandline tool used for generating compact textures for 
use with alpha testing and alpha thresholding. This is done to achieve crisp 
looking textures with minimal video memory footprint.

The technique used is based on Valves [paper](http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) 
from Siggraph 2007
